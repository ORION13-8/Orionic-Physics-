    <h1>Thesis: The Collapse of a Star to the Size of a Quark - A Druid Particle</h1>
    <p>By: <strong>Aryan Verma</strong></p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This thesis explores the possibility of a star, such as our Sun, collapsing to a size where it becomes a "Druid" particle, a hypothetical quark-sized entity. The collapse has profound implications on the formation of new universes or the development of black holes. By integrating General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Cosmology, this study presents potential outcomes of such a collapse and their relevance to the cyclical nature of the cosmos.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts and Theories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Relativity (Einstein)</strong>: Describes the behavior of large-scale objects under the influence of gravity.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>: Governs the behavior of particles on subatomic scales, explaining phenomena such as wave-particle duality.</li>
            <li><strong>Schwarzschild Radius</strong>: The critical radius at which a collapsing star’s mass becomes a singularity.</li>
            <li><strong>Planck Mass</strong>: A theoretical mass unit beyond which quantum gravitational effects dominate.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmic Inflation</strong>: A rapid expansion of the early universe that solves many cosmological problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Big Bounce & Multiverse Theory</strong>: Concepts suggesting that the universe undergoes cyclical expansions and contractions.</li>

        <h2>Energy Production in Stellar Collapse</h2>
        <p>The energy produced during the collapse of a star into a "Druid" particle can be modeled as an exponential increase. Below is a graphical representation of the energy produced during this collapse.</p>

        <pre>

        <h2>Entropy Change During Collapse</h2>
        <p>As the star compresses, the entropy increases, leading to a higher state of disorder. Below is a representation of how entropy increases during the collapse:</p>

        <pre>
Entropy (J/K)   
  |                              *
  |                            *   
  |                          *     
  |                        *       
  |                      *         
  |                    *           
  |                  *             
  |                *               
  |              *

  |*                                 
  |--------------------------------------- Time (ms)
             Collapse Initiation → Peak Entropy
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Density of the Druid Particle</h2>
        <p>As the collapsing star shrinks, its mass is compressed into an ever-decreasing volume. Below is a graph showing the increase in density as the star compresses into a Druid particle:</p>

        <pre>
Density (kg/m³)  
  |                           *      
  |                        *          
  |                     *             
  |                  *                
  |               *                   
  |            *                      
  |         *                         
  |      *                            
  |   *                               
  |*

             Collapse Initiation → Peak Density

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The collapse of a star into a "Druid" particle presents a unique insight into the end stages of stellar evolution. By applying the principles of General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Thermodynamics, we see how such a collapse could lead to the formation of black holes or even new universes, establishing an ongoing cosmic cycle. These concepts align with theories such as the Big Bounce and multiverse theories, suggesting that the death of one universe could lead to the birth of another, furthering the idea of a cyclical cosmic structure.</p>
